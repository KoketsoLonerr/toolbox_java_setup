# JetBrains Toolbox Installation Script

This Bash script automates the installation of JetBrains Toolbox and sets up the latest version of Java on a Linux system. JetBrains Toolbox allows you to easily manage and update JetBrains IDEs.

## Prerequisites

- A Linux system, preferably a Debian-based distribution like Ubuntu.
- A working internet connection to download the necessary packages.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository containing the script to your machine.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

3. Make the script executable by running the following command:

   ```bash
   chmod +x install_jetbrains.sh
   ```

4. Execute the script:

   ```bash
   ./install_jetbrains.sh
   ```

5. The script will check for the latest version of JetBrains Toolbox, download it, and install it on your system. It will also check for the presence of Java and install OpenJDK 11 if it's not already installed.

6. After completion, JetBrains Toolbox and Java will be set up on your system.

## Notes

- If you encounter any issues or the script fails to download JetBrains Toolbox, please visit the [JetBrains Toolbox website](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/download/download-thanks.html?platform=linux) and manually download the latest version. Update the script with the appropriate URL.

- This script is designed for Debian-based Linux distributions. If you're using a different distribution, you may need to modify the package manager commands to match your system.
- You can periodically run this script to ensure you have the latest version of JetBrains Toolbox and OpenJDK.
